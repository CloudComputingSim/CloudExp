 * The LoginOperation is an operation that logs in as a random user. If the

 * The process of logging in as a random user entails picking a random user
 * ID, mapping the ID to a username deterministically, and finally logging in
 * by constructing a post message where the user password is the ID.<br />
 * <br />
 * The application is checked (via parsing of the document) for indication
 * that the login succeeded; the logged in state is saved.
